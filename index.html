  <div class="camerap">
  <p> Cameras haven't always been digital and instant, they have had many different looks throughout the years.  The first camera was successful in the mid-1820's, where it was a peice of paper covered in silver chloride in a wooden box that captured an image when exposed to light then closed into darkness.  It took them many tries in order to successfully capture one image.  Throughout the years after that improvements were made and images were easier to obtain.  Fast foward to 1948 and the first instant image camera was created, this was called, "Polaroid".  Polaroid would go on to become a very famous and popular camera providing the user the picture directly after taking it.  Later in the 1900's camera were able to have film where you could go to stores such as walgreens and have them developed.  Now in modern times, cameras are found everywhere and save the image digitally and easily.  The camera came from humble beginnings, but some of the original technology still survives today. </p>

        <p>I would call 150 words “paragraph length” as 150 words is a decent size for a paragraph. We actually use 150 words as the standard for a shorter forum post in the university where I teach. To demonstrate, this piece of writing, as it is written out here, is about 150 words in length. That's not very long!</p>
