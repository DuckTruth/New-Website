  <div class="camerap">
  <p> Cameras haven't always been digital and instant, they have had many different looks throughout the years.  The first camera was successful in the mid-1820's, where it was a peice of paper covered in silver chloride in a wooden box that captured an image when exposed to light then closed into darkness.  It took them many tries in order to successfully capture one image.  Throughout the years after that improvements were made and images were easier to obtain.  Fast foward to 1948 and the first instant image camera was created, this was called, "Polaroid".  Polaroid would go on to become a very famous and popular camera providing the user the picture directly after taking it.  Later in the 1900's camera were able to have film where you could go to stores such as walgreens and have them developed.  Now in modern times, cameras are found everywhere and save the image digitally and easily.  The camera came from humble beginnings, but some of the original technology still survives today. </p>

  <h3> The Developments of Laptops </h3>
</div>
    <div class="laptopsp">
    <p>In 1982 the first laptop was released, it was called the Grid Compass and it ended up weighing over 5 pounds, that is no where near to how light laptops are now.  After that, the first apple laptop was released, it weighed even more and was recieved horribly.  Those two failures led to the IBM thinkpad, which was wildly popular providing a full open and close top and the first trackpad on a laptop.  The think pad was released in 1992, and the line still exists today and is used mainly in schools.  In 1999 apple had their ressurgence with the apple ibook which started the trend for the shinier design and easy carry to use.  It was very popular with buisnessmen and was lighter then its ancestor.  After the ibook, dell ruled the 2000's when it came to laptops.  There were so many different types but the popularity of them was insane, they were light, able to connect to wifi, and had enough space on it for most people.  The laptops were able to launch dell to the popularity its at today.  Now in modern times laptops are able to be detached, folded all the way around, and touchscreen, but they were always like this. </p>

</div>
      <div class= "televisionsp">
         <p>Television is a staple in the United States, its hard to walk around the streets or into homes/buisness's without seeing one.  Originally, the television used to be black and white, have a very boxy wooden and old appearance and have only one or two channels available.  This was the case for the television for many years, but then color came out and televsion stared gaining popularity over the radio.  Televisons still kept their basic boxy look, but when it gained more popularity more channels came, more companies were created to make televisions, and more shows and movies were created starting the booming buisness of acting in America.  As the popularity grew for the television, its size started to shrink.  Television would eventually lose weight gaining the iconic flat screen look and being able to be hung on walls and be set on top of cabinets.  Televisions now in the modern time come in almost any size and now have a curved screen for easier wacthing angles for the viewer.  Television is one of the most important wants for people everywhere. </p>
